# First Grep

Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

## Check file type

```
file file

file: ASCII text, with very long lines
```

## Find flag

```
grep 'picoCTF' file

picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_dba08a45}
```

## Flag

```
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_dba08a45}
```
